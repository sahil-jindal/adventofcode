/**
 * The direct reverse-engineered approach was chosen to bypass computationally intensive instruction-by-instruction 
 * simulation, which becomes impractical for Part 2 due to exponentially increasing iterations. By analyzing the 
 * assembly code, we identified the critical loop governing register 1â€™s value at the exit check (instruction 28). 
 * This loop combines bitwise operations (e.g., bori 65536, bani 255) and modular arithmetic (muli 65899, bani 16777215)
 * to generate values. Instead of simulating all steps, we extracted the mathematical formula: each iteration starts with 
 * r2 = r1 | 0x10000, processes its bytes, and updates r1 via masked multiplication and addition. Tracking these values 
 * directly allows detecting cycles efficiently. Part 1 returns the first computed value, while Part 2 tracks the last 
 * unique value before repetition. This method reduces runtime from days to milliseconds by leveraging pattern recognition 
 * and mathematical optimization, avoiding brute-force execution.
